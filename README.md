## Overview

InsureScore is a revolutionary driver behavior scoring system designed to transform road safety through innovative technology.
This repository houses the core components and documentation for the InsureScore project.


## Features

- **Behavior-Based Scoring System:**
  - Evaluate various aspects of a driver's behavior, including speeding, crash frequency, and adherence to traffic rules.

- **Real-Time Safety Alerts:**
  - Seamlessly integrated into smartphones and car tablets, providing instant safety alerts based on driving conditions.

- **V2V Communication System:**
  - Establishes a robust Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) communication system using IoT sensors to facilitate anonymous data sharing between vehicles.

- **Anomaly Detection through IoT Sensors:**
  - Utilizes a suite of IoT sensors, including accelerometers, GPS receivers, and more, to detect dangerous accelerations and assess driving conditions.

- **Weather-Adaptive Speed Limits:**
  - Dynamically adjusts speed limits based on real-time weather conditions for enhanced safety.

- **Risk Assessment for Insurance Agencies:**
  - Targets insurance agencies, providing a comprehensive data-driven approach to risk assessment and personalized premium calculations.

## Proof of Concept

As a proof of concept, we have conducted [simulations]([kaggle-notebooks/InsureScore_Simulation_Analysis.ipynb](https://www.kaggle.com/chaimabalti/enit-sb-ras-2023)) of car behavior in a fixed road environment. The simulations were executed both without InsureScore and after its implementation, utilizing various probabilistic models. The results clearly demonstrate the positive impact of InsureScore on road safety, showcasing a reduction in risky behaviors and potential accidents.

For detailed statistics and analysis, refer to the accompanying [Kaggle notebook]([kaggle-notebooks/InsureScore_Simulation_Analysis.ipynb](https://www.kaggle.com/chaimabalti/enit-sb-ras-2023)).
