## Overview

InsureScore is a revolutionary driver behavior scoring system designed to transform road safety through innovative technology.
This repository houses the core components and documentation for the InsureScore project.

## Problem Statement

Road safety is a critical global concern, and InsureScore aims to tackle the challenges associated with risky driving behaviors. This section outlines the main issues in road safety and the impact of human factors on accidents.

## Solution Overview

InsureScore's solution involves a scoring and alert system that evaluates driver behavior in real-time. Learn about the key components, scoring metrics, and how the alert system enhances road safety.

## Technical Architecture

Understand the technical aspects of InsureScore, including how IoT sensors, V2V communication, and the integration with car tablets contribute to the overall functionality.

## Proof of concept: Simulation

A probabilistic simulation conducted before and after the implementation of InsureScore. Analyzing the impact of InsureScore on accident frequency, speeding incidents, and overall road safety.

## Report

[This](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1TSb4lGD4TSaCLf47dP260j6MxKipLbl1/view?usp=sharing) report file has all the details about our solution to the Ras Challenge, InnovateSafe Roads.
## Proof of Concept

As a proof of concept, we have conducted [Simulation](https://github.com/ChaimaBalti/TSYP-RAS-CHALLENGE-ENIT-2023/tree/526246c257b992138375911f9e46b9ffac76a486/Proof%20of%20concept#proof-of-concept)
 of car behavior in a fixed road environment. The simulations were executed both without InsureScore and after its implementation, utilizing various probabilistic models. The results clearly demonstrate the positive impact of InsureScore on road safety, showcasing a reduction in risky behaviors and potential accidents.
